ISSUES
- Check cart not cleared after success page display?

TODO
- add web hook handling feature 
- add capture, void, refund transactions and order status for webhook
- update transaction id for MOTO void and refund using webhook
- add the place order API (with MADA support)
- Handle refund in verify as in place order if order creation fails
- add shipping handling for instant payment, currently flatrate_flatrate not good
- add customer details to payment requests
- Replace APM id by title in list 

TASKS
- do CLR to LF normalisation
- move common payment method functions to an abstract class
- update git ignore
- check deleted vault cards not removed from db
- check all translation strings
- Add instant purchase note in order somewhere
- move strings to constants and centralize definitions
- move the placeOrder calls in controllers to a centralised processOrder call in orderHandlerService (duplicated code in placeOrder and verify controllers)

OPTIONAL
- add advanced Frames localisation and style parameters?
- check after multiple failed requests (add idempotency?)
- add MOTO partial capture feature?
- add vault extra config parameter fields from config.xml + instant purchase control
- convert card icons to base 64 for account and vault list display
